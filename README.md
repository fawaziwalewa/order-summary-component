# Frontend Mentor - Order Summary Card Solution

This is my solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). The project allowed me to sharpen my HTML, Tailwind CSS, and responsive layout skills by building a clean, card-based UI.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge gave me a great opportunity to practice using Tailwind's utility classes to create a visually appealing layout. I also refined my approach to centering content vertically and horizontally using `flex` and `min-h-screen`.

```html
<main class="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
  <!-- card content -->
</main>
````

### Continued development

I plan to keep focusing on:

- Perfecting responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints
- Improving accessibility with semantic markup and `aria` attributes
- Making my designs feel more interactive with transitions and subtle animations
